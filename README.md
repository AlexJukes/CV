As someone who passionately believes that big ideas can change the world, it's no surprise that I'm passionate about coding. Through code, abstract concepts become practical applications, translating our ideas into reality and changing peoples' lives.

As a student at [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/), I gained an incredible grounding in the fundamental principles of good software design, and learned not just how to code, but more importantly _how to learn how to code_. By the end of the course, I had learnt an entirely new language and technology to write and fully TDD a functioning [Ethereum blockchain application](https://github.com/UltimateCoder00/Makers-Society) within the space of 10 days. It's meant that as a Junior Developer at Softwire, I could start writing production code from day 1 of being put on a project, and was productive enough to be billable to the client in under 2 months. And when stepping in to be a coach for new learners joining the Softwire apprenticeship scheme, I was able to apply those OOD principles to a new language, C#, and break down the important concepts effectively enough to successfully coach students with their learning as well as contribute to course materials.

 I'm now looking to continue my journey in software development in a role where I can learn and grow both as a developer and as an individual, with a focus on Software Craftsmanship and XP values in a positive and inclusive workplace.

#### Communication

Communication is fundamental to any good software design. Whether communicating with clients to understand the needs of the product, communicating with your team to conceive and create that product, or communicating the decisions and processes that shaped it to future developers through the design of the code itself, communication is the first step towards making an idea a reality.

With a background as Head of Content Strategy for the successful start-up [Radish Fiction](https://www.radishfiction.com/) and experience as a freelance web designer, I have the ability to communicate ideas about technology to hundreds of thousands of users or individual clients in written, verbal and visual form.

#### Independent Learning

Makers Academy, Oxford University, and becoming a self-taught Web Designer all required one key fundamental trait - the ability to learn new concepts and techniques quickly and independently. Makers pride themselves less on teaching people how to code than _how to learn_ how to code. In other words, teaching one how to think about problems and reach solutions both independently and as part of a team, rather than being spoon-fed the answers.

The same philosophy was present during my undergraduate experience reading History at St Hugh's College, Oxford, where we would be expected to produce well-researched essays on brand new topics within a few days. Receiving the highest mark for a dissertation in my college demonstrates that when left to research and understand a topic independently, I can understand, synthesise and present new information and ideas effectively.

These skills were just as vital when it came to teaching myself HTML, CSS as well as some PHP and JavaScript in order to get paid work as a Freelance Web Designer. My success in all three fields is a result of my ability to pick up new ideas quickly, apply them intelligently and, most importantly, being able to ask the right questions when I don't have the answers.

#### Interpersonal

Pair programming was at the core of the Makers Academy curriculum, and I relished the opportunity to work with others and write code together. I quickly realised that just as everyone is unique, so too is the way they code. Embracing challenging personalities and difficult feedback as sources of learning and growth rather than fear and apprehension is probably one of the most valuable skills I learned at Makers Academy.

I already had a good grounding though. At Radish Fiction I was personally responsible for on-boarding and managing the most successful writer on the platform, among many others, with the CEO trusting that I could handle the egos that come with talent. As a freelance web designer and developer, maintaining good relationships with clients was paramount for earning repeat business.
