As someone who passionately believes that big ideas can change the world, it's no surprise that I'm passionate about coding. Through code, abstract concepts become practical applications, translating our ideas into reality and changing people's lives.

As a student at [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/), I gained an incredible grounding in the fundamental principles of good software design, and learned not just how to code, but more importantly _how to learn how to code_. For our final project these skills, combined with my passion for ideas and technology, led my team and I to create an application that used blockchain technology as the basis for a [simple proto-society](https://github.com/UltimateCoder00/Makers-Society), including its own crypto-currency and voting system.

 I'm now looking to continue my journey in software development in a role where I can learn and grow both as a developer and as an individual, with a focus on Software Craftsmanship and XP values in a positive and inclusive workplace.

#### Communication

Communication is fundamental to any good software design. Whether communicating with clients to understand the needs of the product, communicating with your team to conceive and create that product, or communicating the decisions and processes that shaped it to future developers through the design of the code itself, communication is the first step towards making an idea a reality.

With a background as Head of Content Strategy for the successful start-up [Radish Fiction](https://www.radishfiction.com/) and experience as a freelance web designer, I have the ability to communicate ideas about technology to hundreds of thousands of users or individual clients in written, verbal and visual form.

#### Independent Learning

Makers Academy, Oxford University, and becoming a self-taught Web Designer all required one key fundamental trait - the ability to learn new concepts and techniques quickly and independently. Makers pride themselves less on teaching people how to code than how to learn how to code: in other words, how to think about problems and reach solutions independently and as part of a team rather than being given the answers.

The same philosophy was present during my undergraduate experience reading History at St Hugh's College, Oxford, where we would be expected to produce well-researched essays on brand new topics within a few days. The fact that I achieved the highest mark for a dissertation in my college is evidence of the fact that when left to research and understand a topic independently, I can understand and synthesise new information effectively.

These skills were just as vital when it came to teaching myself HTML, CSS and some PHP and JavaScript in order to get paid work as a Freelance Web Designer. My success in all three fields is a result of my ability to pick up new ideas quickly, apply them intelligently and, most importantly, being able to ask the right questions when I don't have the answers.

#### Interpersonal

Pair programming was at the core of the Makers Academy curriculum, and I relished the opportunity to work with others and write code together. I quickly realised that just as everyone is unique, so too is the way they code. Embracing challenging personalities and difficult feedback as sources of learning and growth rather than fear and apprehension is probably one of the most valuable skills I learned at Makers Academy.

I already had a good grounding though. At Radish Fiction I was personally responsible for on-boarding and managing the most successful writer on the platform, among many others, with the CEO trusting that I could handle the egos that come with talent. As a freelance web designer and developer, maintaining good relationships with clients was paramount for earning repeat business.
